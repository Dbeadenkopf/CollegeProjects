#Description: The program is able to calculate the answer to an integer divisin
#problem without using the division, integer division, mod, or multiplication
#operators.
#The program should ask the user for two integers, and should compute the
#answer to firstNum // secondNum. The program should then output the
#full equation, including the answer, to the user
