Important:
	To know the the rules of the hands and the winning hands
	
suits dont matter

4 of a kind:
 
Normal kind:
      4 queens with a 10, 10 is better than a kind

3 of a kind:
  10 3 pair 10s beat 9 3 parir even if 10 has 2 aces its goes boh of the hand

Poker ranks:
      all are mutaly exclusive
      no full house flush
      there will be combinations that can combine together like straight flush
      or roayl straight flush which does nto excist
     
notes:
	nothing to chang in card class 
	points() is an accesor function
	points() in whihc aces are always 14
	cSuit value
	typeDef and cSuit = (new type)
	ex cSuit mSuit so mSuit is of type cSuit
	typedef unsigned int cPoints;
	now cPoints m_points  
	bool m_valid -> determines wther hand is valid
	pRank m_rank -> computes rank like full house, straight flush


function notes:
	 isTwoPair();
	 ** sort hand by point value first 
	 9_ 9_ j_ j_ k_
	 !check if 99 and jj are the same or different
	 9 9= 9 10   k k 
	 2 9 9 j j
	 need to do 3 different checks
	 numbers of checks will be in number patter 2-2-1
	 comparison Function
	 ** can just compare the hands
	 hard part ** comparing the other 2 hands and deciding whiich one is bigger          

	 no cehcking for duplicate hands
	 two strait flushes, 
	 comparing 5 cards in the array that was created
