5. Applications (your thoughts) of this project
************************************************************************
- My thoughts on this project are intersting. Again, complicated for myself
- to keep track of the string taken in by the user and then comparing it to the record strings.
- I kept getting the wrong number of occurances, I also had invalid string a bunch of times but changing
- some logic and figuring out how to total the number of occurances to give that information back to
- the user took me like 3 days to understand. I know pathetic........-_-
